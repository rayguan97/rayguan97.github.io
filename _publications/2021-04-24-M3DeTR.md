title: "M3DeTR: Multi-representation, Multi-scale, Mutual-relation 3D Object Detection with Transformers"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-04-24-M3DeTR
excerpt: 'We present a novel architecture for 3D object detection, M3DeTR, which combines different point cloud representations (raw, voxels, bird-eye view) with different feature scales based on multi-scale feature pyramids. M3DeTR is the first approach that unifies multiple point cloud representations, feature scales, as well as models mutual relationships between point clouds simultaneously using transformers. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI 3D object detection dataset and Waymo Open Dataset.'
